A simple web frontend to test all Piazza API test cases.

## Features

## Setup

### 1. Update API URL

The API URL is already configured in `api.js`:

```

If your API is running on a different URL, update this line.

### 2. Run the Frontend

```bash
cd cam-frontend

# Build and run with docker-compose
docker compose up -d

# Or build manually
docker build -t piazza-frontend .
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name piazza-frontend piazza-frontend
```

Then open: **http://localhost:8080**

To stop:
```bash
docker compose down
# or
docker stop piazza-frontend
```

#### Option 2: Using Python HTTP Server
```bash
cd cam-frontend
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open: http://localhost:8000

#### Option 3: Using Node.js http-server
```bash
cd cam-frontend
npx http-server -p 8000
```

Then open: http://localhost:8000

#### Option 4: Using Live Server (VS Code Extension)
